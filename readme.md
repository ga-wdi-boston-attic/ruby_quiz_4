# This is a quiz on ruby and writing tests!

Please see `quiz_spec.rb` and `quiz.rb`.

The first tests for the first question are already written.
NO THEY'RE NOT!

Write the corresponding code.

Run `$ rspec spec/` to see if your tests pass.

For the remaining questions write __both__ the tests and functions.
YOU MEAN EVERYTHING?!
